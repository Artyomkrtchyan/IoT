## 📘 About the Project

This repository was created as part of a university project at UFAR (Université Française en Arménie) in collaboration with 42 Yerevan / TUMO Labs.  

The project is dedicated to building an Air Monitoring System — an IoT-based solution that collects, processes, and visualizes air quality data from different sensors.

The goal is to design a working IoT infrastructure that can be used for both educational and research purposes, demonstrating how environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, particulate matter, gases, etc.) can be monitored in real time.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Collects data from multiple air quality sensors (PM2.5, CO₂, temperature, humidity, etc.)  
- Wireless data transmission (Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, etc.)  
- Data processing and storage (locally and/or on a server)  
- Web interface / dashboard with charts, alerts, and history  
- Modular design for easy extension with new sensors or analysis methods
