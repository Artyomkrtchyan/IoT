# IoT

ðŸ“˜ About the Project
This repository was created as part of a university project at UFAR (UniversitÃ© FranÃ§aise en ArmÃ©nie) in collaboration with 42 Yerevan / TUMO Labs.

The project is dedicated to building an Air Monitoring System â€” an IoT-based solution that collects, processes, and visualizes air quality data from different sensors.

The goal is to design a working IoT infrastructure that can be used for both educational and research purposes, demonstrating how environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, particulate matter, gases, etc.) can be monitored in real time.

ðŸ§© Key Features
Collects data from multiple air quality sensors (PM2.5, COâ‚‚, temperature, humidity, etc.)
Wireless data transmission (Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, etc.)
Data processing and storage (locally and/or on a server)
Web interface / dashboard with charts, alerts, and history
Modular design for easy extension with new sensors or analysis methods
